 ### Pyramid Generator
 **Things Learned** - Okay, I felt this, a bit more complicated compared to Legacy Javascript introduction tutorial. 
  Basically we are passing in the character, no of rows using variable **count** and whether we want a straight pyramid or an inverted pyramid.
  An array that has elements which are arrays is built and each item is displayed. Each row is an array --> this is attained using function call.
  To create all the arrays according to count ---> we created a for loop.
  To display each row on to the console another FOR loop was used.

  
**Thoughts** - I am planning to create a game using the above code where the user can pass in the character, no.of rows and whether inverted or straight.

**Time Taken to complete the FCC tutorial** -  2.30hrs
